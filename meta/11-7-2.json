The revised, federally recognized definition of rape makes the crime gender neutral (previously, men were excluded from being victims); either gender can be victim or perpetrator. The new definition also includes instances of rape with an object, as well as instances in which the victim is incapable of giving consent because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity, including due to the influence of drugs or alcohol.","source_organisation_2":"U.S. Department of Justice","source_url_2":"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-eric-holder-announces-revisions-uniform-crime-report-s-definition-rape","comments_limitations":"Data gathered from The 2015 City of Los Angeles Report on the Status of Women and Girls, Part 5: Public Safety","source_geographical_coverage_2":"National (U.S.)","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-05-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/angelamhkim/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/fe04099b56851a6a03feb517d2822caab66fe281","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-06-25: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/angelamhkim/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/4ac2b12b981da22e8bfc484c4da117daa1c56384","page_content":""}
