Anyone may initiate a request for public records.\nThe California Public Records Act requires an Agency to provide a response to the public records request within 10 calendar days. \nPublic Record requests from the Office of the City Clerk may include a wide variety of documents and other materials (including print, photographic, and electronic formats) that were created or obtained by the department and are, at the time the request is filed, in the department's possession and control.

Prior to April 2006, there were seven Coroners\u2019 districts in Northern Ireland.
